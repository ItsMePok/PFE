### Vanilla Files modified:

Here are the vanilla files That PFE modifies & could cause issues with other addons

Any vanilla files here do not have a significant impact on gameplay & can be removed if needed (or you can just have PFE below the ones that use these)

#### Fonts:

**glyph\_F0.png**

* Used for the Emojis on Spawn Eggs
* Location: [PFE\_RP/font/glyph\_F0.png](../PFE\_RP/font/glyph\_F0.png)
* What happens when another pack uses this?: The Emojis that were used will show incorrectly (will show up as what the other pack used in that slot)
* unused in vanilla

#### Brewing Recipe:

**minecraft:brew\_water\_sugar**

* Used to brew Sugar Water (there is alternative ways to get this item)
* Location: [PFE\_BP/subpacks/main/recipes/food/sugar\_water.json](../PFE\_BP/subpacks/main/recipes/food/sugar\_water.json)
* Used in vanilla as a way to craft the [Mundane Potion](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Potion#Base\_potions) (there is other ways to get this in vanilla other than this recipe)
