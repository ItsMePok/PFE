### Removed Emerald Pickaxe and Axe

{% hint style="info" %}
This change was made since a lot of other add-ons have added their own version of the vanilla emerald toolset



PFE tools and weapons (ex: Haxel & Battleaxe) will keep their emerald variants
{% endhint %}

### Any Amethyst tool/weapon/armor has been renamed to Creedite[^1]

{% hint style="info" %}
This change was also made as amethyst tools and armor are typical additions in other Add-Ons.



As of right now there is not a way to obtain Creedite so the recipes will temporarily remain unchanged. In the next update there will be a proper way to obtain Creedite blocks & shards



Amethyst Upgrader is not affected by this change and will remain as is.

### Updated @minecraft/server to 2.4.0

### Updated format\_versions to 1.21.130

### All identifiers that were previously prefixed with "poke:", "poke-pfe:", "pfe:" have been updated to use "poke\_pfe:"

* <mark style="color:red;">**THIS CHANGE WILL RESULT IN A LOSS OF ITEMS FORM WOLRDS WHEN UPDATING FROM OLDER VERSIONS OF PFE**</mark>
* <mark style="color:red;">**THIS MAY ALSO BREAK SOME ADD-ON COMPATABILITY**</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
This change should have happened a long time ago.



This scale of a breaking update should never happen again.
{% endhint %}

### Changed some identifiers to better reflect what they are currently

* This would include things like the Onyx Haxel  (which is now: "poke\_pfe:onyx\_haxel") as it used to be "poke:haxel" since it was the only one at the time

### Removed any deprecated items

* Since all the identifiers are changing this update, it not seem necessary to keep these for backwards compatibility
