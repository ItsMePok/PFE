### Added the ability for other Add-Ons to add their own quests

```typescript
/*
Add-On Creators: You can add quests into PFE's quest system.

Note: the custom quests get re-initialized each time the world starts. 
This is to ensure that players will not get quests for Add-Ons that 
are no longer in the world. (Quests can be added at any time after the world loads)

Note x2: Quests that have been rolled not be able to be changed

This is example code. This will add a Mine quest for 7x Cut Cobalt for 7x Copper Tokens:
*/
import { ItemStack, world } from "@minecraft/server"
interface PFECustomQuests {
  value: [{
    requiredItem: {
      item: string,
      amount: number
      translationString: string
    },
    reward: {
      tokenAmount: number,
      item?: ItemStack tead (MAY NOT WORK IN CUSTOM QUESTS)
    }
  }]
}
interface PFEQuestInfo {
  requiredItem: {
    item: string, // the identifier of the required item
    amount: number // amount of the item the player needs in order to complete this quest
    translationString: string // this follows the same syntax as the minecraft:display_name component
  },
  reward: {
    tokenAmount: number, // number of Copper Tokens the player receives
    item?: ItemStack // optional: an itemStack that the player would receive ins
  }
}
interface PFECustomQuests {
    value: PFEQuestInfo[]
}
const PFECustomMineQuestsPropertyID = `poke_pfe:custom_mine_quests`
const PFECustomFarmQuestsPropertyID = `poke_pfe:custom_farm_quests`
const PFECustomCraftQuestsPropertyID = `poke_pfe:custom_craft_quests`
const PFECustomKillQuestsPropertyID = `poke_pfe:custom_kill_quests`

world.afterEvents.worldInitialize.subscribe((data) => {
  const AddedMineQuests:PFECustomQuests = {
    value: [
      { requiredItem: { item: `poke:cut_cobalt`, amount: 7, translationString: `%poke_pfe.cut_cobalt (%poke_pfe.tag)` }, reward: { tokenAmount: 7 } }
    ]
  }
  world.getDimension(`minecraft:overworld`).runCommand(`scriptevent poke_pfe:custom_mine_quests ${JSON.stringify(AddedMineQuests)}`)
})

```

### Added `pfe:is_haxel` & `minecraft:is_tool` tag to all haxels

### Removed world dynamic property: `poke_pfe:existed` mentioned in last beta's changelog as it does not work as intended

{% hint style="info" %}
basically, other Add-Ons cannot interact with dynamic properties of other Add-Ons
{% endhint %}

### Added a scriptevent `poke_pfe:enabled`&#x20;

* This will send true (as a string) to the scriptevent id provided in the message

{% hint style="info" %}
Example command: `/scriptevent poke_pfe:enabled poke_pfe:receive_test`

This would send true (as a string) to the script event id of `poke_pfe:receive_test`
{% endhint %}
