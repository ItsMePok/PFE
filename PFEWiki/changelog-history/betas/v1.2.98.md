### Added Upgrader

* This is a block that can be used to view and upgrade items
  * It is planned to add more features to this block in the future

### [Alloy Forge](../../blocks/crafters/alloy-forge.md) will now emit a light level of 11

### Adjusted [Duster](../../blocks/automation/duster.md)

* Increased time between triggers: 0.5s → 2s
* When placing this, it will face in the same direction as the face of the block you placed it on
* Can now convert these to gravel
  * [Cobbled Limestone](../../blocks/misc/cobbled-limestone.md)
  * [Cobbled Shadowstone](../../blocks/misc/cobbled-shadowstone.md)
  * Blackstone
  * Cobbled Deepslate

### Adjusted [Dirter](../../blocks/automation/dirter.md)

  * [Cobbled Shadowstone](../../blocks/misc/cobbled-shadowstone.md)
  * Blackstone
  * Cobbled Deepslate

{% hint style="info" %}
With these changes existing Dusters and Dirters will need to be updated



Existing ones will automatically be converted into the new variant when they try to trigger again

* Rotation will be preserved
* You may need to break and replace them if they do not convert automatically



Note: Removed features will remain in the files (they may not remain functional) for at least 5 Full Release updates (ex: The old versions of these blocks could be fully removed from starting in v1.3.5). This is to keep PFE's download size & performance impact as small as possible
