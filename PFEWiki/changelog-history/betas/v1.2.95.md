### You are no longer able to break blocks that are a higher tool tier than itself with [Haxels](../../tools/haxel/)

{% hint style="info" %}
This means for example:

[Wooden Haxels](../../tools/haxel/wooden-haxel.md) used to be able to break blocks such as [Diamond Ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Diamond_Ore)

Normally this would require a [Pickaxe](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe) with [iron tier](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tiers) or above for it to drop
{% endhint %}

### Adjusted the break speed of [Haxels](../../tools/haxel/)

### Added a recipe to convert old quest items into [their new version](../../items/quests/)

* Some sensitive effects like [Night Vision](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Night_Vision) will not get its duration affected by changing this

### [Haxels](../../tools/haxel/) will now only pull the blocks it broke to the player

### When breaking a significant number of blocks with a [Haxel](../../tools/haxel/) without [Silk Touch](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Silk_Touch), it will no longer deafen the user

### [Windzooka ](../../tools/misc/windzooka.md)& [Blazooka](../../tools/misc/blazooka.md) should now launch the player more accurately when looking straight up or down

### Radius Effects for [Death](../../armor/full-armor-sets/death-armor.md), [Cactus](../../armor/full-armor-sets/cactus-armor.md) & [Medic](../../armor/full-armor-sets/medic-armor.md) now works again

{% hint style="danger" %}
### (Add-On Integration) Breaking Changes:

* Imports sent via `/scriptevent` must be sent after `world.afterEvents.worldLoad` would trigger
  * It may be best to wait a few seconds after worldLoad before attempting to send the imports
  * Why?: Due to a change in @minecraft/server v2.0.0 I cannot reset prior imports until after worldLoad
* Set effects presets: `maxAmp` was renamed to `max_amp`
{% endhint %}

### Updated format versions to 1.21.90

### Updated `minecraft/server` & `minecraft/server-ui` to version 2.0.0

### Default quests are now stored on the item rather than in the script

* This does not affect Custom Quests

### Adjusted the way custom Quests are formatted

* This does not affect Custom Quests
* Existing quests will be automatically converted to the new format when attempting to roll the quest

### Renamed Custom Components:

* poke:haxelMining -> poke\_pfe:box\_mining
* poke:cc\_on\_use -> poke\_pfe:run\_command
* poke:cas -> poke\_pfe:play\_music
* poke:cc\_zooka -> poke\_pfe:launch\_user

### Added Component Paramaters to the following component:

{% hint style="info" %}
Other Add-ons can apply & use components

They will not function unless PFE is enabled, but will not break the item if the component is not defined

The item's `format_version` must be 1.21.90 or higher

### Main hand can now contribute to set effects

### Set Effect duration has been reduce to 300 ticks on non-sensitive[^4] effects

### When breaking blocks with poke\_pfe:box\_mining without [Silk Touch](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Silk_Touch) the blocks dropped now [considers the tool used when dropping items](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]

### Adjusted the way [Cassette's](../../items/cassettes/) descriptions are handled

### Removed some unnecessary block states

* This mainly applies to deprecated blocks where those state were no longer needed

### PFE Sound Identifers are now all prefixed with `poke_pfe.`

### Added a warning message that will display if an older version of PFE is applied to the world

* This will only display a warning if the older version is v1.2.95 or above

[^1]: The default attack damage of this item before any enchantments are applied

[^2]: Multiplied by 2

    Ex: Void Haxel has a default attack damage of 18

    So, the mining speed on the Void Haxel would be 36 (18\*2)

[^3]: This excludes the nebula variant\\

    This was to make them all use the same texture file

    You may notice a difference some of the texture, but they are as close as I could get them to the original

[^4]: This is effects like night vision where the screen starts to flash if the duration is close to expiring

[^5]: Now in order for this block to drop its item the item that triggered this component needs to be able to break this block
