This means for example:

Wooden Haxels used to be able to break blocks such as Diamond Ore



Normally this would require a Pickaxe with iron tier or above for it to drop

{% hint style="danger" %}
## (Add-On Integration) Breaking Changes:

* Imports sent via `/scriptevent` must be sent after `world.afterEvents.worldLoad` would trigger
  * It may be best to wait a few seconds after worldLoad before attempting to send the imports
  * Why?: Due to a change in @minecraft/server v2.0.0 I cannot reset prior imports until after worldLoad
* Set effects presets: `maxAmp` was renamed to `max_amp`
{% endhint %}

### Updated format versions to 1.21.90

### Updated `minecraft/server` & `minecraft/server-ui` to version 2.0.0

### Default quests are now stored on the item rather than in the script

* This does not affect Custom Quests

### Adjusted the way custom Quests are formatted

* This does not affect Custom Quests
* Existing quests will be automatically converted to the new format when attempting to roll the quest

### Renamed Custom Components:

* poke:haxelMining -> poke\_pfe:box\_mining
* poke:cc\_on\_use -> poke\_pfe:run\_command
* poke:cas -> poke\_pfe:play\_music

### Added Component Paramaters to the following component:

{% hint style="info" %}
Other Add-ons can apply & use components



They will not function unless PFE is enabled, but will not break the item if the component is not defined



The item's `format_version` must be 1.21.90 or higher
{% endhint %}

        }
<strong>    ]
</strong>}
</code></pre>

* poke\_pfe:custom\_quests\_info
  * This is an item component that contains additional options for dealing with custom quests that are imported via scriptevent

```json
// Example component
"components": {
    "poke_pfe:custom_quests_info": {
        "version": 1,
        "custom_quest_dynamic_property": "poke_pfe:custom_craft_quests"
    }
}
```

* poke\_pfe:box\_mining
  * This component can be used to allow an item function like the Haxels

	"can_break_indestructible": false,
	"break_sound": "dig.stone"
},
```

* poke\_pfe:upgradable
  * This component can be used to allow this item to support upgrades with items such as cores
  * For now, only current PFE upgrades can be used, it is planned to have the ability to define custom upgrades to an item/item tag

```json
// Example Component
"poke_pfe:upgradeable": {
	"version": 1,
	"dynamic_property": "pfe:upgrades",
	"sneak_interact_opens_ui": true, // Default is false

		"pfe:flaming",
		"pfe:persistence"
	]
}
```

* poke\_pfe:set\_effects
  * This component can be used to define what set effects this item will apply when equipped
  * Default PFE set effect tags will no longer work&#x20;

```json
"poke_pfe:set_effects": [
	{
		"version": 1,
		"mode": "effect",
		"effect": "minecraft:speed", // Effect identifier
		/* The highest max amplifier of 
		currently equipped items will take priority */

],
```

### Main hand can now contribute to set effects

### Set Effect duration has been reduce to 300 ticks on non-sensitive[^3] effects

### When breaking blocks with poke\_pfe:box\_mining without Silk Touch the blocks dropped will now [considers the tool used when dropping items](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]

### Adjusted the way Cassette's descriptions are handled

### Removed some unnecessary block states

* This mainly applies to deprecated blocks where those state were no longer needed

### Added a warning message that will display if an older version of PFE is applied to the world

* This will only display a warning if the older version is v1.2.95 or above

[^1]: The default attack damage of this item before any enchantments are applied

[^2]: Multiplied by 2



    Ex: Void Haxel has a default attack damage of 18&#x20;



    So, the mining speed on the Void Haxel would be 36 (18\*2)

[^3]: This is effects like night vision where the screen starts to flash if the duration is close to expiring

[^4]: Now in order for this block to drop its item the item that triggered this component needs to be able to break this block
