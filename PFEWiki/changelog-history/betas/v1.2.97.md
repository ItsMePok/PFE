### Bears no longer use the Polar bear's animation controllers

### Adjusted Custom Component Paramaters:

* poke\_pfe:run\_command (Item component)
  * Added the ability to use a string array instead of a string to execute multiple commands without using functions
  * Added property `mode: ("on_use" | "on_use_on")[]`
    * This is a string array that allows you to set what will allow this to trigger
    * Currently the only supported options are "on\_use" and "on\_use\_on"
    * Omitting `mode` will make the item only use: "on\_use"&#x20;
* poke\_pfe:sponge\_block (Block component)
  * This allows you to have a block "absorb" nearby blocks if it touches specific block(s)
  * Component example:

```json
"poke_pfe:sponge_block": {
	"adds_to_stat": "lava_sponged", // Used for Computers Add-On integration
	"check_for_blocks": [ // What blocks will trigger the absorbing (& get absorbed)
		"minecraft:flowing_lava",
		"minecraft:lava"
	],
	"mode": ["place","tick"], // how this will check
	"offset": [0,0,0], // Absorb offset
	"sound": { // Sound that gets triggered when it absorbs blocks
		"identifier": "sponge.absorb" // Sound identifier
	},
	"sponge_size": [20,20,20], // Absorb Size [X,Y,Z] (centered on the block) 
	"turns_into": "poke:molten_lava_sponge" // What this block turns into after it absorbs 
}
```

* poke\_pfe:change\_state (Block component)
  * This allows you to change the state of a block
  * Currently it only supports changing `minecraft:block_face` based on the side you interact with
  * Component example:

```json
"poke_pfe:change_state": {
	"mode": ["on_player_interact"],
	"change_based_on": "interacted_face",
	"change_state": "minecraft:block_face",
	"face": "all",
	"sound": {
		"identifier": "poke_pfe.calibrate",
		"pitch": 1,
		"volume": 1
	}
}
```

* poke\_pfe:break\_blocks (Block component)
  * This allows you to break blocks adjacent to the this block
  * Component example

```json
"poke_pfe:break_blocks": {
	"targets": [
	  "West"
	]
}
```

* poke\_pfe:place\_blocks (Block component)
  * This allows you to place blocks adjacent to this block
  * Component example:

```json
"poke_pfe:place_blocks": {
	"places": "minecraft:cobblestone",
	"targets": [
	  "Up"
	]
}
```

* poke\_pfe:transform\_block (Block component)
  * This can be used to change this block into a different block
  * Component example

```json
"poke_pfe:transform_block": {
	"turns_into": "poke:block_breaker{\"minecraft:block_face\":\"down\"}"
}
```

### All PFE's particle identifiers are now prefixed with: poke\_pfe:

### Removed a bunch of function that are no longer nessicary

[^1]: For example:

    If for some reason End Stone were to generate in the overworld and Void Ore would have generated at that location; End Void Ore would be placed rather than nothing



    This should almost never happen unless you are using custom biomes that add such blocks in that dimension
