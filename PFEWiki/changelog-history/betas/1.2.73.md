### Fixed an issue where some [Traders](../../mobs/traders/) trades were missing if placed in [v1.2.7](../full-releases/v1.2.7.md)

* you will need to kill & replace those [Traders](../../mobs/traders/) to fix the trades

### Fixed an issue where some [Traders](../../mobs/traders/) would not drop their Spawn Egg when killed

### Fixed an issue where some items could not be used

* this mainly applied to items that shot projectiles (ex: [Rings](../../tools/rings/) & [Burstbows](../../weapons/burstbows/))

### [Haxel's](../../tools/haxel/) blacklist now forces identifiers to be lowercase

* In some cases, this caused block(s) to ignore the blacklist even if it showed the block as being in the blacklist
* Existing [Haxel's](../../tools/haxel/) blacklist will be automatically updated when using them next



## **Technical Changes**

### Moved a bunch of texture paths so they are now under `poke/pfe/`

* this is to improve compatibility & does not have an impact on gameplay
