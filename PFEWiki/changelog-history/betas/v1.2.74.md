### Fixed an issue where the [Carved Melon's](../../blocks/melons/) Face was not visible on some variants

### [Splash Death Potions](../../items/potions/splash-death-potion.md) will now be consumed on use



## **Technical Changes**

### Moved all possible texture paths so they are now under `poke/pfe/`

* This is to improve compatibility & does not have an impact on gameplay
* Due to current component limitations [some textures](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] are still under `textures/items/`

[^1]: The target is the mob/entity you hit

[^2]: This includes things like Cake & the PFE trader spawn eggs.



    Any recipe that uses the `minecraft:egg` tag will allow it to be used

[^3]: It should only be the Gift Box & its associated textures that remain in this path.
