* ![:repair\_core:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1223313088908890142.webp?size=56\&quality=lossless) Balancing :3

### A very disregardable list:

_**Balancing**_

* Due to popular demand, we have removed the arms of the furnace golem
* Changed They Listen track because it didn't have enough lines
* Retextured Listener because it was too cold
* Removed the Quest trader's legs because it did not meet the trade quota
* Removed color from items because color is overrated
* Knightling & Battleaxes can now play Megalovania because um why not
* Knightling are more likely to spawn in boss events because jedi is progressing to fast
* Removed Herobrine because I forgot again
* Cobalt Golem was too small
* Changed Godly Ore's Texture because it wasn't very chobblesome
* if (block.name == "limestone") { setTexture("super\_secreat\_limestone\_dark\_mode") };
* You now no longer get to know what Sporecat you're taming because cosmetic trader stopped selling the trash lid
* Added Cobalt trapdoor because mushroom wanted me to so um
* You can now eat banished star x3 because :3
* Some Traders got their yearly hair cut
* Some other changes that were not deemed significant enough to type out
