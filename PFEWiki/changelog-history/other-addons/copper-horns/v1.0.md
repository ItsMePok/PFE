***

This addon mimics how the copper horns worked in vanilla (with some additional features), more info on how they used to work can be found on the Minecraft Wiki: [Copper Horn – Minecraft Wiki](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fminecraft.wiki%252fw%252fCopper_Horn)

***

#### Copper Horns will play a sound based on what you are doing:

1. **If jumping**: Plays all 3 tunes simultaneously
2. **If crouching**: Plays the Bass Tune
3. **If looking up (above 45°)**: Plays the Harmony Tune
4. **If none of the above**: Plays Melody Tune

#### Copper Horns can also be dyed (because why not lol)

#### 2 Additional Goat horns can also be obtained; they are a rare drop from goats
