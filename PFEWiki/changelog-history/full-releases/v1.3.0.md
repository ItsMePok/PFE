[^1]: This Includes:\
    [Goggles](../../armor/cosmetics/helmet-cosmetics/goggles.md)

    [Night Vision Goggles](../../armor/cosmetics/offhand-cosmetics/night-vision-goggles.md)

[^2]: For example:

    If for some reason End Stone were to generate in the overworld and Void Ore would have generated at that location; End Void Ore would be placed rather than nothing



    This should almost never happen unless you are using custom biomes that add such blocks in that dimension (which will soon be possible without experimental toggles)

[^3]: This is as of Minecraft Bedrock v1.21.80

[^4]: The default attack damage of this item before any enchantments are applied

[^5]: Multiplied by 2

    Ex: Void Haxel has a default attack damage of 18

    So, the mining speed on the Void Haxel would be 36 (18\*2)

[^6]: This excludes the nebula variant\\

    This was to make them all use the same texture file

    You may notice a difference some of the texture, but they are as close as I could get them to the original

[^7]: This included functions relating to:

    * Old set effect system
    * Old quest system
