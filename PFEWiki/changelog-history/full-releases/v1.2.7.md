### Adjusted block break times

* Most break times have been increased if you are not using the proper tools&#x20;
* This now also applies to:
  * Bricks&#x20;
    * Preferred tool: Pickaxe
  * Bulbs
    * Preferred tool: Pickaxe
  * Walls
    * Preferred tool: Pickaxe
  * Cut Blocks
    * Preferred tool: Pickaxe
  * All Ores
    * Preferred tool: Pickaxe

{% hint style="info" %}
A tool is considered a pickaxe if it has the `minecraft:is_pickaxe`tag.

If another add-on adds a custom pickaxe, it should already work



If you find tool(s) that should be working to break that block but is not let me know in the discord



Also, any feedback on the new break times would be appreciated
