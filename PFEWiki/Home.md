## Vanilla Files modified:
Here is the vanilla files That PFE modifies & could cause issues with other addons

Any vanilla files here do not have a significant impact on gameplay & can be removed if needed (or you can just have PFE below the ones that use these)

### Fonts:

**glyph_F0.png**
 - Used for the Emojis on Spawn Eggs
 - Location: [PFE_RP/font/glyph_F0.png](https://github.com/ItsMePok/PFE/blob/main/PFE_RP/font/glyph_F0.png)
 - What happens when another pack uses this?: The Emojis that were used will show incorrectly (will show up as what the other pack used in that slot)
 - unused in vanilla

### Brewing Recipe:

**minecraft:brew_water_sugar**
 - Used to brew Sugar Water (there is alternative ways to get this item)
 - Location: [PFE_BP/subpacks/main/recipes/food/sugar_water.json](https://github.com/ItsMePok/PFE/blob/main/PFE_BP/subpacks/main/recipes/food/sugar_water.json)
 - Used in vanilla as a way to craft the [Mundane Potion](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Potion#Base_potions) (there is other ways to get this in vanilla other than this recipe)
