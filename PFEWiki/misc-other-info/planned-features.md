# Planned Features

These are thing I want to add to PFE if/when possible

{% hint style="info" %}
Have an idea for PFE (or other addons)?

You can suggest your own ideas in the PFE Discord [#pfe-discord-server](../#pfe-discord-server "mention")
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Things that are listed here are not guaranteed to be added, there may be limitations (or just a skill issue on my part lol) that could result in an idea being held back/scrapped
{% endhint %}



## Boss Event config for Op

* ~~would allow you to change the chances of bosses spawning (or disable them outright)~~
* ~~this would likely be an item that will open a Ui (only if operator) & will allow you to modify those settings~~
* It may be craftable so players can get it without using cheats
* this item should only be useable by operators

***

## Haxel Rework

* ~~Haxels should be reworked to be fully controlled within scripts (interact ability)~~
* Maybe change the trigger to the block mined rather than interact? (or add config menu)
* Config menu to set a blacklist on blocks it shouldn't break with the ability (on a player (or item?) level)
* Particles around the break radius to better show that it is working
* ~~Ban Hammer should also be able to obtain bedrock~~
* ~~Haxels should not break liquids~~

***

## Item Dying

* Items some items/tools should be dyeable to give the player a way to distinguish tools apart
  * use case: distinguishing similar items at a glance (ex: when having the same item w/ different enchants (fortune / silk touch))
* This should apply to all tools
* Could also apply to some items for decorative purposes

***

## Cassette Trader - Llama variant

* 1-3 different variants
  * likely a retro style?
* could also drop a cosmetic
