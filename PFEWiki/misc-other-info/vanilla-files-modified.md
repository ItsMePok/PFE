# Vanilla Files modified

Here are the vanilla files That PFE modifies & could cause issues with other addons

Any vanilla files here do not have a significant impact on gameplay & can be removed if needed (or you can just have PFE below the ones that use these)

#### Fonts:

**glyph\_F0.png**

* Used for the [Emojis ](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/emojis.html#app)on Spawn Eggs
* Location: [PFE\_RP/font/glyph\_F0.png](https://github.com/ItsMePok/PFE/blob/main/PFE\_RP/font/glyph\_F0.png)
* What happens when another pack uses this?: The [Emojis](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/concepts/emojis.html#app) that were used will show incorrectly (will show up as what the other pack used in that slot)
* unused in vanilla

#### Brewing Recipe:

**minecraft:brew\_water\_sugar**

* Used to brew Sugar Water (there is alternative ways to get this item)
* Location: [PFE\_BP/subpacks/main/recipes/food/sugar\_water.json](https://github.com/ItsMePok/PFE/blob/55329d771e5ba49d1c2304403e8ae8ac1e9c5d4d/PFE\_BP/recipes/food/sugar\_water.json)
