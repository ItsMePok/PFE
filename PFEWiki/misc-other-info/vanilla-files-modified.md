# Vanilla Files modified

Here are the vanilla files That PFE modifies & could cause issues with other addons

Any vanilla files here do not have a significant impact on gameplay & can be removed if needed (or you can just have PFE below the ones that use these)

***

### Fonts:

**glyph\_F0.png**

* Used for the [Emojis](emojis.md) on Spawn Eggs & Entity Names (& a few other item/block names)
* Location: RP/font/glyph\_F0.png
* What happens when another pack uses this?: The [Emojis](emojis.md) that were used will show incorrectly (will show up as what the other pack used in that slot)
* Unused in vanilla

***

### Brewing Recipe:

**minecraft:brew\_water\_sugar**

* Used to brew <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81d985f3-0c44-468e-ba2e-65c26664b823" alt="" data-size="line"> [Sugar Water](../items/foods/sugar-water.md) (there is alternative ways to get this item other than brewing)
* Location: BP/recipes/food/sugar\_water.json
* Used in vanilla as a way to craft the [Mundane Potion](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Potion#Base_potions) (there is other ways to get this in vanilla other than this recipe)
