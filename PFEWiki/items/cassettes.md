# Cassettes

## General Info:

* Interacting with them will fade out the current music playing and play the music listed on it
* Cassettes that are crafted from the vanilla music discs can also be put in jukeboxes
* You need to have game music on in order to hear the cassettes (Settings -> Audio -> Music > 0)
