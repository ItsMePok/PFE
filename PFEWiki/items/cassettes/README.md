* Interacting with them will fade out the current music playing and play the music listed on it
* Crouching & interacting with them will queue that track to play
  * more than 1 track can be queued at a time
* Cassettes that are crafted from the vanilla music discs can also be put in jukeboxes
* You need to have game music on in order to hear the cassettes (Settings -> Audio -> Music > 0)
