Anyone is allowed to view/learn from the code of PFE
if you have any questions about addons you can ask me on discord (username: itsmepok) im basically always open to helping
things marked with "-c" at then end of the file name have a bunch of comments in them to help understand what some things do
(Im trying to make the code more readable so sorry if there is still some areas that are not very organized(most things should be good though))
