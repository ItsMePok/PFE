## Other Random Notes:
* Anyone is allowed to view/learn from the code of PFE
* if you have any questions about addons you can dm on discord (username: itsmepok) im basically always open to helping
* Im trying to make the code more readable so sorry if there is still some areas that are not very organized (most things should be good though)
* files marked with "-c" (not many rn, list below) at then end of the file name have a bunch of comments in them to help understand what some things do
